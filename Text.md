# Who am I

(Hi, I'm Ale, but you can call me Bunz!)  
Hi there, my name is Bunz!
I'm a curious 18 years old student from Italy that likes to always discover new things. I've got a lot of hobbies such as sports, photography, music and coding (you can see my projects here). In all of them I'm always in research to something that can make me better than before, that makes me improve my knowledge and my skills: I'm always learning from anything that life puts me in front of. 

## Programming
Currently I'm learning to code with Python, HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript, I studied Django to deploy this website, and Rainmeter. 
The next coding languages I want to learn are Flutter, GO and C or C++, while I want to improve my knowledge on Javascript. 

## Other Projects
Producing music is also one of the things I'm currently learning, but I don't know if I'll be able to reach my goals. 
About photography maybe I'll put some of my work here in the future.
